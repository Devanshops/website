## Overview

MCollective provides extensive input data validation to prevent attacks and injections into your agents preventing attack vectors like Shell Injection Attacks.

We supply a number of pre-made validator plugins that can be used in agents and DDL files and you are capable fo adding your own easily.

This section of the documentation have recently been migrated from the old mcollective documentation, we are still in the process of verifying every example works in modern mcollective.  If you find any issues please get in touch.

## Writing A New Validator

We'll write a new validator plugin that can validate a string matches valid Exim message IDs like *1Svk5S-0001AW-I5*.

Validator plugins and their DDL files goes in the libdir in the *validator* directory on both the servers and the clients.

### The Ruby Plugin

The basic validator plugin that will validate any data against this regular expression can be seen here:

```ruby
module MCollective
  module Validator
    class Exim_msgidValidator
      def self.validate(msgid)
        Validator.typecheck(msgid, :string)

        raise "Not a valid Exim Message ID" unless msgid.match(/(?:[+-]\d{4} )?(?:\[\d+\] )?(\w{6}\-\w{6}\-\w{2})/)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

All you need to do is provide a _self.validate_ method that takes 1 argument and do whatever validation you want to do against the input data.

Here we first confirm it is a string and then we do the regular expression match against that.  Any Exception that gets raised will result in validation failing.

### The DDL

As with other plugins these plugins need a DDL file, all they support is the metadata section.

```ruby
metadata    :name        => "Exim Message ID",
            :description => "Validates that a string is a Exim Message ID",
            :author      => "R.I.Pienaar <rip@devco.net>",
            :license     => "ASL 2.0",
            :version     => "1.0",
            :url         => "http://devco.net/",
            :timeout     => 1
```

## Using the Validator in a DDL

You can use the validator in any DDL file, here is a snippet matching an input using the new *exim_msgid* validator:

```ruby
action "retrymsg", :description => "Retries a specific message" do
    display :ok

    input :msgid,
          :prompt      => "Message ID",
          :description => "Valid message id currently in the mail queue",
          :type        => :string,
          :validation  => :exim_msgid,
          :optional    => false,
          :maxlength   => 16

    output :status,
           :description => "Status Message",
           :display_as  => "Status"
end
```

Note here we are using our new validator to validate the *msgid* input.

## Using the Validator in an Agent

Agents can also have validation, traditionally this included the normal things like regular expressions but now here you can also use the validator plugins:

```ruby
action "retrymsg" do
  validate :msgid, :exim_msgid

  # call out to exim to retry the message
end
```

Here we've extended the basic *validate* helper of the RPC Agent with our own plugin and used it to validate a specific input.

## Listing available Validators

You can obtain a list of validators using the *plugin* application:

```nohighlight
% mco plugin doc

Please specify a plugin. Available plugins are:

Validator Plugins:
  array                     Validates that a value is included in a list
  exim_msgid                Validates that a string is a Exim Message ID
  ipv4address               Validates that a value is an ipv4 address
  ipv6address               Validates that a value is an ipv6 address
  length                    Validates that the length of a string is less or equal to a specified value
  regex                     Validates that a string matches a supplied regular expression
  shellsafe                 Validates that a string is shellsafe
  typecheck                 Validates that a value is of a certain type

```

Note our new _exim_msgid_ plugin appears in this list.
