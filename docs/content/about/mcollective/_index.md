On the 17th of July 2018 Puppet Inc officially announced that as of release 5.5.4 of the Puppet Agent The Marionette Collective has been deprecated.

While the Choria project builds heavily ontop of the foundation laid by The Marionnette Collective this does not mean an end or even a significant hurdle for this project.

We welcome users of The Marionette Collective who wish to continue using it, we have gone to great length to ensure you can continue as always - and the Choria project added a lot of new and exciting features to the platform.

Today in Puppet 5.x there is no concern everything continues to work, once Puppet 6 is released there will be a short delay until the Choria project is ready to run on Puppet 6.

Please review the [Choria Website](https://choria.io) for further information about the Choria project.

We are working with Puppet Inc to take over items like the code, mailing lists and more, this page will get further updates as details become clear.
