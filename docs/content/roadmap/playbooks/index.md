## Introduction

See the [playbooks section](/docs/playbooks/) for intro material

## Features

This is a rough feature set, individual pieces are explored in more detail below:

### General

   - [x] It should support metadata like author, version, tags etc suitable for searching and cataloging on a web interface
   - [x] It should support many groups of named *node sets*, node set sources can be MCollective or many other sources
   - [x] It should support many named *inputs* usable from the CLI
   - [x] It should support declaring desired versions of MCollective agents and support verifying that nodes match expectation
   - [x] It should support tasks with common behaviours like retries and soft/hard failures etc
   - [x] It should support many types of task like MCollective RPC, Webhooks, Slack, Ticket systems etc
   - [x] It should support hook tasks to run on success, failure, between other tasks etc
   - [x] It should have a flexible playbook language that is pure data and support templating to fill in input data and reference node sets
   - [x] It should be standalone runable from the CLI
   - [x] It should be non interactive runs with rich reporting while being paramaterised
   - [x] It should have a custom logger format that shows the context as it moves through the playbook flow
   - [x] It should have support for distributed key/value stores used in locks, inputs, node sets and tasks
   - [x] It should produce reports that can be stored in JSON or in a webservice for later retrieval ([#88](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues/88))
   - [ ] It should support *macros* that ship with mcollective agent plugins and bring reusable self container utility logic
   - [ ] It should support versioned playbook schemas so we can ensure an incoming playbook is usable by the system ([#87](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues/87))
   - [ ] It should have JSON schemas for the full playbook schema - partially completed
   - [ ] It should validate incoming playbooks using the JSON schema
   - [ ] It should have an optional webservice where playbooks are stored and later ran under
   - [ ] It should be compatible with MCollective AAA, a webservice should be able to run commands as a certain user
   - [ ] It should support pluggable Node sources so users can extend it ([#90](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues/90))
   - [ ] It should support pluggable Task types so users can extend it ([#89](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues/89))
   - [ ] It should support arbitrarily named tasks lists and ability to run those from within a task list to facilitate reusing of logic ([#91](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues/91))

### Inputs

   - [x] Defined inputs should be sourced from external systems when not supplied

### Node Sets

   - [x] It should be able to do MCollective discovery
   - [x] It should be able to make arbitrary PQL queries
   - [x] It should be able to run shell scripts and get certnames from there
   - [x] It should be able to load node set groups from YAML
   - [x] It should be able to use terraform outputs
   - [x] It should support data sources
   - [ ] It should be able to get node groups from PE classifications
   - [ ] It should be able to get node groups from foreman classifications
   - [ ] It should be able to query EC2 and search by tag for nodes

### Tasks

   - [x] It should be able to make MCollective requests
   - [x] It should be able to make make assertions about MCollective request state
   - [x] It should be able to run local shell scripts
   - [x] It should be able to make GET and POST requests to arbitrary webhooks
   - [x] It should be able to send messages to Slack
   - [x] It should support data stores
   - [ ] It should be able to run terraform
   - [ ] It should be able to initiate and wait for servers to be built by razor

### Data Sources

   - [x] Should support dynamic inputs
   - [x] Should be able to write and delete from data stores in tasks
   - [x] Should have a in-memory data store
   - [x] Should have a consul based data store
   - [ ] Should have a etcd based data store
   - [ ] Should have a vault based data store

Ticked features are implemented and usable today.

A number of [issues have been opened on GitHub](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplaybooks) to track work on this feature.
