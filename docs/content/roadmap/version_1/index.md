Version 1 of these modules and plugins seems about due after good feedback from everyone.

There is a [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria/milestone/2) with most of these captured
and will likely be more accurate

Apart from obvious things like being generally stable and reliable I specifically want these features:

 - [x] Secure easy to deploy SSL based security system that uses Puppet CA
 - [x] Secure easy to deploy SSL secured NATS connector with SRV support
 - [x] PuppetDB and PQL integration
 - [ ] Complete Playbooks to solid v1
 - [x] The new JSON based audit plugin on by default
 - [x] The new JSON based registration plugin on by default
 - [x] A *choria* GitHub org
 - [x] A *choria* forge namespace
 - [x] Versioned docs
 - [x] Logo

For playbooks:

 - [x] a playbook level data source definition
 - [x] reports, versioned format
 - [ ] versioned playbook document even though we wont have schemas yet
 - [x] memory data store
 - [x] consul data store
 - [x] inputs from the data store
 - [x] data store write task
 - [x] data store read task

Data store locks - anything that needs a session - are probably going to be post 1.0.0, the data store is described in the playbook spec doc

Stretch Goals, but probably only after 1.0.0:

 - [ ] etcd data store
 - [ ] A replacement for *mco rpc*
 - [ ] ActiveMQ that's like the NATS one - unconditional SSL, same SRV records
 - [ ] RabbitMQ that's like the NATS one - unconditional SSL, same SRV records
