I typically release around the 20th of the month, this one was a bit delayed while I worked with the NATS project on some problems we encountered. Nothing major in these releases as I have been traveling and working on a large implementation.

For Puppet users there is a potential big change to look out for, Choria has a stated goal of:

```
Choria sets up the popular Action Policy based authorization and does so in a default deny mode which means by default, no-one can make any requests
```

There was a problem though in that any modules that had no explicit policies would end up being in default allow mode, this addressed across a few of these updates so you might need to keep an eye on this in your environment.

Special thanks to Romain Tarti√®re and Konrad Scherer for their contributions during this cycle.

## Choria Server 0.10.1

Links: [Changes](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/compare/0.10.0...0.10.1), [Release](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/releases/tag/0.10.1)

### Bugfixes

On large networks - around 25 000 nodes or more - we observed some instability in the clustering of Choria Brokers, you would see log lines like these:

```
rid:16993 - Slow Consumer Detected: WriteDeadline of 5s Exceeded
```

This indicates that the route connection (hence `rid` and not `cid`) between brokers would get disconnected. This turned out to be a regression upstream that I worked with the NATS team to resolve.
