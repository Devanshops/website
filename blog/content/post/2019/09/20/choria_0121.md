Today we are doing a series of long overdue Puppet Module releases as well as a reasonably significant Choria Server update.

Significantly this delivers the new [External Agents](https://choria.io/blog/post/2019/09/18/external_agents/) I blogged about recently.

Read on for all the details!

## Thanks

Thanks to Alexander Hermes, Steven Pritchard, Paul Tittle, Vincent Janelle and Ben Roberts for making these releases possible.

## Choria Server 0.12.1

Links: [Changes](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1), [Release](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/releases/tag/v0.12.1)

This is quite a big release with significant new features:

### Enhancements

 * [External Agents](https://choria.io/docs/development/mcorpc/externalagents/) allow you to write agents in any language
 * RPC Authorization built into the Go Server thats compatible with *action_policy* (off by default)
 * A new tool to generate DDL files `choria tool generate ddl x.json x.ddl`, it can also convert JSON to Ruby

To enable the new Choria Server based authorization just set `rpcauthorization: 1` in your hiera data, it is off by default since it applies to all agents including any existing Ruby ones.  I invite the community to test this in their labs, we'll set it to on by default in the next release.
