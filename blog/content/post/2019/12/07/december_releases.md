It's been a while since we had release announcements and it's been a surprisingly busy period.

The main focus here has been on a number of stability and bug fixes, we've had some users dig in really deep into various aspects of the system and a number of bugs were squashed.

Past the quality of life stuff I have started reworking Choria Server Provisioning which will set us on a path to having a good Puppet free story, I have some POCs lying around of a Kubernetes based Broker, CA, and Provisioner that will give a really smooth path forward - provisioning is now compiled in to the FOSS stack by default and can be enabled using a JWT token, more on that in a future post. 

We also include a Tech Preview of [NATS JetStream support](https://choria.io/blog/post/2019/12/06/jetstream_adapter/) and significantly moved our event formats over to [Cloud Events v1.0](https://choria.io/blog/post/2019/12/05/cloudevents_transition/) format.

Thanks especially go to Alexander Hermes for his deep dive into all aspects of the client side playbooks. Deep dives into a product and filing some tickets, discussing the model on slack etc it hugely time consuming and very often this kind of community contribution flies under the radar but I find it more valuable than code, huge props to Alexander.

Other shout outs to Ben Robert, Yury Bushmelev, Romain Tarti√®re and Vincent Janelle
