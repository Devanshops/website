## Choria Server

Many small changes and improvements with quite big internal code refactors. Previously we had many different Golang packages compiled into Choria Server now we have a mono repo.

A major addition is that you can now view all configuration settings and their values on the CLI, read [our blog post for more details](https://choria.io/blog/post/2020/02/13/configuration/).

We have done major work on Windows support - it can run as a service, write logs to Windows event log and we have initial packages.
