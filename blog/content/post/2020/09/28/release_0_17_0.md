Today we have quite a bumper release with significant updates for [Choria Scout](https://choria.io/docs/scout/) and
the first step in [improvements for AAA Service managed clients](https://choria.io/blog/post/2020/09/13/aaa_improvements/).

We added numerous Choria Scout CLI tools - `choria scout status`, `choria scout trigger`, `choria scout maintenance`
and `choria scout resume`.  These allow you to manage a fleet of Choria nodes that are performing Scout checks.

$ choria scout status dev1.example.net

```

The `choria req` utility got a new `--table` format option and all the result rendering code got extracted into a 
reusable package.

```

We improved generated Go clients significantly by allowing them to have typical progress bars, `choria req` like result
formatting, result parsing helpers, improved logging and faster discovery.  These features are show cased in the new 
`choria scout` commands that are built entirely by using abilities of the generated clients. We also significantly 
simplified the code for `choria req` by using the same features.
