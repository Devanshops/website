We had a release quite recently but I wanted to release a number of Scout related features to early adopters, these
releases are mainly focussed on Scout but includes a few bug fixes and new builds for Ubuntu Focal (20.04 LTS).

The big item here is that we have integrated [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) into the Scout framework and
it can now run validations regularly. See the [Scout Goss](../scout_goss/) blog post for details.

You'll also notice a new agent - `scout` - on your nodes, this gives API access to interact with Scout checks on Choria
servers.

Additionally, we are starting to work on our documentation for Scout, an [initial cut of this is also published today](https://choria.io/docs/scout/),
this shows our Puppet integration, Prometheus integration and a bit about the events.

Thanks to Romain Tarti√®re for contributions to these releases.

Read on for the full details.
