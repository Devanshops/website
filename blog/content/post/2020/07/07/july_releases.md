We have a number of releases to announce today, the focus is general quality of life improvements in addition to 
the features to support out larger Choria Server release that included our [announcement of Choria Scout](https://choria.io/blog/post/2020/07/02/choria_scout/).

With these releases you can create Scout checks on your machines using:

```puppet
choria::scout_check{"check_typhon":
    plugin            => "/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_procs",
    arguments         => '-C typhon -c {{ o "warn" 1 }}:{{ o "crit" 1 }}',
    remediate_command => "service typhon restart",
}
```

In addition to this we have fixed `mco puppet runall` when using Choria Server, I know quite a few people have wanted to
see the return of this utility.

Thanks to Romain Tarti√®re for contributions to these releases.
